Animal Tales : Stories in which animals are the main characters and often possess human traits.

Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. As the pigs grew older, their mother decided it was time for them to go out into the world and seek their fortunes.

Before they left, she warned them, “Whatever you do, do it the best that you can because that’s the way to get along in the world.”

The three little pigs set off, and each one decided to build a house to protect themselves from the big bad wolf who lived in the nearby woods.

The First Little Pig
The first little pig was the laziest of the three. He decided to build his house out of straw because it was the easiest and quickest material to work with. He finished building his house in no time and spent the rest of the day relaxing.

The Second Little Pig
The second little pig was slightly more industrious than the first. He decided to build his house out of sticks. It took a bit more effort than the straw house, but he was still able to finish it fairly quickly. He then joined his brother in playing and relaxing.

The Third Little Pig
The third little pig was the hardest working of the three. He decided to build his house out of bricks. It took a lot of time and effort, but he was determined to build a strong house that would protect him from the wolf. Finally, after many days of hard work, he completed his sturdy brick house.

The Big Bad Wolf
One day, the big bad wolf came to the first little pig’s house. He knocked on the door and said, “Little pig, little pig, let me come in!”

The little pig replied, “Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!”

So the wolf said, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house down!” And with a great huff and a puff, the wolf blew the straw house down. The first little pig ran to his brother’s stick house for safety.

The wolf then came to the second little pig’s house. He knocked on the door and said, “Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!”

The pigs replied, “Not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!”

So the wolf said, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house down!” And with a great huff and a puff, the wolf blew the stick house down. The two little pigs ran to their brother’s brick house for safety.

The wolf then came to the third little pig’s house. He knocked on the door and said, “Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!”

The pigs replied, “Not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!”

So the wolf said, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house down!” The wolf huffed and puffed, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t blow the brick house down. He became very angry and decided to trick the pigs.

The Wolf’s Tricks
The wolf climbed up on the roof and tried to come down the chimney. But the third little pig was clever. He put a pot of boiling water in the fireplace. When the wolf came down the chimney, he fell right into the pot of boiling water and was scalded. He let out a yelp and jumped out of the pot, running away into the woods and never to bother the three little pigs again.

Conclusion
The three little pigs were safe and sound in their sturdy brick house. The first and second little pigs learned a valuable lesson about the importance of hard work and perseverance. They all lived happily ever after, knowing they had built a home that would keep them safe.

And so, the three little pigs enjoyed their lives in peace and security, always remembering the lesson that their hard work and dedication had taught them.
The Bremen Town Musicians
Once upon a time, there was a donkey who had worked for many years for a miller, carrying heavy sacks of grain. As the donkey grew older, he became weaker and less able to work. Fearing that his master would get rid of him, the donkey decided to leave and seek his fortune. He set out for Bremen, a town known for its freedom, where he hoped to become a town musician.

On his way, the donkey met a dog lying by the roadside, panting and looking very tired.

"Why are you panting so, my friend?" asked the donkey.

"Ah," replied the dog, "I am old and weak, and can no longer hunt. My master wanted to kill me, so I ran away. But how will I make a living now?"

"Come with me to Bremen," said the donkey. "I am going to become a town musician, and you can join me and play the drums."

The dog thought this was a good idea and joined the donkey on his journey.

A little further along the road, they met a cat sitting in the path, looking very sad.

"What's the matter, old whiskers?" asked the donkey.

"How can I be happy?" answered the cat. "I am old, my teeth are dull, and I prefer to sit by the fire and purr rather than catch mice. My mistress wanted to drown me, so I ran away. But what can I do now?"

"Come with us to Bremen," said the donkey. "We are going to become town musicians, and you can join us and play the fiddle."

The cat agreed and joined the donkey and the dog.

As they continued on their way, they came across a rooster sitting on a gate, crowing loudly.

"Why are you crowing so loudly?" asked the donkey. "You should be enjoying the day."

"I am crowing because I overheard my mistress say that she is going to cook me for supper tomorrow," replied the rooster. "I don't want to be made into soup, so I am crowing while I still can."

"Come with us to Bremen," said the donkey. "We are going to become town musicians, and you can join us and sing with your powerful voice."

The rooster agreed and joined the donkey, the dog, and the cat.

The four animals continued their journey to Bremen, but as night fell, they became tired and decided to rest in a forest. They found a large tree to sleep under. The rooster, who could see further because of his height, noticed a light in the distance and told his companions.

"There must be a house nearby," said the rooster. "Maybe we can find shelter there for the night."

The animals followed the light and soon came to a house. Peeking through the window, they saw a band of robbers feasting and counting their stolen goods. The animals devised a plan to scare the robbers away.

The donkey stood with his front hooves on the window sill, the dog climbed on the donkey's back, the cat perched on the dog's back, and the rooster flew up to the top. At a signal, they all began to make their respective noises: the donkey brayed, the dog barked, the cat meowed, and the rooster crowed. The cacophony of sounds startled the robbers, who thought it was a ghost or monster attacking them. They ran out of the house in fear, leaving their feast and treasure behind.

The animals entered the house and enjoyed the food and warmth. They decided to stay there for the night. The donkey lay down in the yard, the dog lay behind the door, the cat curled up by the hearth, and the rooster perched on a beam.

Later that night, the robbers returned and sent one of their men to check the house. Seeing it was dark and quiet, he went inside. As he struck a match to light a candle, the cat leapt up and scratched his face. Startled, he stumbled back and stepped on the dog's tail, causing the dog to bite him. As he ran towards the door, the donkey kicked him, and the rooster crowed from his perch. The robber ran back to his comrades, screaming that the house was haunted by terrible monsters.

The robbers never returned, and the animals decided to stay in the house. They never reached Bremen, but they lived happily together in their new home, enjoying the comfort and security they had found.

And so, the donkey, the dog, the cat, and the rooster lived out their days as contented friends, each contributing to their little community in their own special way.

And so, the tale of the Bremen Town Musicians ends, a story of friendship, cleverness, and finding a new purpose in life.
 

Moral Tales : Tales that impart a lesson or moral, often through the consequences faced by the characters.


The Fisherman and His Wife
Once upon a time, there was a fisherman who lived with his wife in a small, dirty shack by the sea. The fisherman went out every day to fish, and one day, as he sat by the shore with his fishing rod, he caught a large flounder. To his surprise, the flounder spoke to him in a human voice.

"Please, fisherman, let me go! I am not an ordinary fish; I am an enchanted prince. If you let me go, I will grant you any wish you desire," said the flounder.

The fisherman, a kind and simple man, was astonished and said, "I don’t need anything. Go, swim away, and be free."

The flounder swam away, grateful for the fisherman’s kindness. The fisherman went home and told his wife, Ilsebill, what had happened. Ilsebill, who was ambitious and dissatisfied with their poor life, was furious.

"You caught an enchanted fish and let it go without asking for anything? Go back and call it! Ask for a better house," she demanded.

Reluctantly, the fisherman went back to the sea and called out:

"Flounder, flounder, in the sea,
Come, I pray thee, here to me;
For my wife, good Ilsebill,
Wills not as I'd have her will."

The flounder surfaced and asked, "What does she want?"

"My wife says I should have asked for a better house," replied the fisherman.

"Go home," said the flounder. "She already has it."

When the fisherman returned, he found a beautiful cottage in place of their shack. His wife was delighted but soon became discontented again.

"This cottage is too small. I want a grand castle," she said.

Once again, the fisherman went to the sea and called out:

"Flounder, flounder, in the sea,
Come, I pray thee, here to me;
For my wife, good Ilsebill,
Wills not as I'd have her will."

The flounder surfaced and asked, "What does she want now?"

"She wants a grand castle," replied the fisherman.

"Go home," said the flounder. "She already has it."

When the fisherman returned, he saw a magnificent castle. His wife was happy but soon wanted more.

"I want to be king," she said.

The fisherman, though reluctant, went back to the sea and called out:

"Flounder, flounder, in the sea,
Come, I pray thee, here to me;
For my wife, good Ilsebill,
Wills not as I'd have her will."

The flounder surfaced and asked, "What does she want now?"

"She wants to be king," replied the fisherman.

"Go home," said the flounder. "She already is."

When the fisherman returned, his wife was sitting on a throne, dressed as a king. But her ambition knew no bounds.

"I want to be emperor," she said.

The fisherman went back to the sea, feeling more and more uncomfortable, and called out:

"Flounder, flounder, in the sea,
Come, I pray thee, here to me;
For my wife, good Ilsebill,
Wills not as I'd have her will."

The flounder surfaced and asked, "What does she want now?"

"She wants to be emperor," replied the fisherman.

"Go home," said the flounder. "She already is."

When the fisherman returned, he found his wife sitting on an even grander throne, dressed as an emperor. But soon, she grew discontented again.

"I want to be pope," she said.

The fisherman went back to the sea and called out:

"Flounder, flounder, in the sea,
Come, I pray thee, here to me;
For my wife, good Ilsebill,
Wills not as I'd have her will."

The flounder surfaced and asked, "What does she want now?"

"She wants to be pope," replied the fisherman.

"Go home," said the flounder. "She already is."

When the fisherman returned, he found his wife sitting on a high throne with three great crowns, surrounded by the splendor of the church. But even this was not enough.

"I want to be like God," she said.

The fisherman, horrified and unwilling, went back to the sea one last time and called out:

"Flounder, flounder, in the sea,
Come, I pray thee, here to me;
For my wife, good Ilsebill,
Wills not as I'd have her will."

The flounder surfaced and asked, "What does she want now?"

"She wants to be like God," replied the fisherman.

The flounder sighed and said, "Go home. She is sitting in her old shack again."

When the fisherman returned, he found his wife sitting in their old, small, dirty shack. All the grandeur and splendor were gone, and they lived there for the rest of their days, never asking for anything more.

And so, the story of the fisherman and his wife ends, a tale of ambition, greed, and the consequences of never being satisfied with what one has.

The Tortoise and the Hare
Once upon a time, there was a speedy hare who bragged about how fast he could run. Tired of hearing him boast, a tortoise challenged him to a race.

"All right," said the hare, laughing at the tortoise's slowness. "Let’s race!"

They agreed on a route and started the race. The hare darted ahead and soon left the tortoise far behind. Confident in his speed, the hare decided to take a nap midway through the race, thinking there was plenty of time to catch up later.

Meanwhile, the tortoise kept going slowly but steadily. He never stopped, and he passed the sleeping hare without disturbing him. The hare slept longer than he intended, and when he woke up and saw the tortoise near the finish line, he dashed off as fast as he could.

But it was too late. The tortoise had crossed the finish line already, winning the race.

Moral of the Story
"The Tortoise and the Hare" is a classic fable attributed to Aesop. The moral of the story teaches us that slow and steady wins the race. It highlights the importance of perseverance, consistency, and humility over arrogance and overconfidence.

And so, the tortoise proved that determination and steady effort can achieve more than swift but inconsistent actions.


The Boy Who Cried Wolf
Once upon a time, there was a shepherd boy who was tasked with watching over a flock of sheep on the outskirts of a village. To entertain himself and alleviate his boredom, he would often shout, "Wolf! Wolf! A wolf is attacking the sheep!"

Upon hearing his cries, the villagers would rush out of their houses and fields to help the boy fend off the wolf. However, when they arrived at the scene, they found no wolf. The boy would just laugh at their gullibility and enjoy the attention.

This happened several times, and each time the villagers would become increasingly annoyed with the boy's antics. They warned him that if he continued to falsely cry wolf, they would no longer come to his aid when a real wolf appeared.

One day, a wolf actually did come to attack the flock. The boy, seeing the wolf approach, cried out in terror, "Wolf! Wolf! Please help!"

But this time, the villagers, remembering the boy's previous false alarms, ignored his cries. They believed it was another trick to get attention and did not come to rescue him or his sheep.

The wolf, unhindered by the villagers, attacked the sheep and scattered them across the fields. The boy watched in horror as the wolf devoured several of his sheep before finally retreating into the forest.

Moral of the Story
The moral of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" is that if you repeatedly lie or deceive others, even for fun or attention, eventually no one will believe you when you tell the truth. It teaches the importance of honesty and integrity, and the consequences of actions that erode trust.

And so, the story of the boy who cried wolf serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the value of credibility and the repercussions of deceit.

One day, the kingdom's prince invited all the maidens to a grand ball at the palace. Cinderella longed to go, but her stepmother forbade it, giving her more chores to keep her busy.

As Cinderella worked, her fairy godmother appeared. With a wave of her wand, she transformed Cinderella’s rags into a beautiful gown, complete with glass slippers, and turned a pumpkin into a magnificent carriage, with mice into horses and a rat into a coachman. But she warned Cinderella to return before midnight, when the magic would wear off.

Cinderella arrived at the ball and immediately caught the prince's eye, who was mesmerized by her grace and beauty. They danced all evening, and Cinderella forgot her fairy godmother’s warning until the clock began to strike midnight. In a panic, she fled from the palace, leaving behind one of her glass slippers.

The prince, determined to find the mysterious maiden, searched the kingdom for the owner of the glass slipper. He visited Cinderella's house, and her stepsisters tried to squeeze their feet into the tiny slipper, but it didn’t fit.

Cinderella’s foot fit perfectly into the slipper, and the prince recognized her as the one he had danced with at the ball. Overjoyed, he took her to the palace, where they were married and lived happily ever after.

The Emperor's New Clothes

Once upon a time, there lived an emperor who was exceedingly fond of new clothes. He spent lavishly on his wardrobe and cared greatly about his appearance. Two swindlers, aware of the emperor's obsession with clothing, devised a cunning plan to exploit his vanity.

They arrived at the imperial palace claiming to be master weavers who could create the most exquisite fabrics imaginable. Not only were their fabrics beautiful, they claimed, but they also possessed magical properties: they were invisible to anyone who was incompetent or unfit for their position.

Intrigued by the prospect of owning such remarkable garments and eager to prove his worthiness as an emperor, the emperor agreed to commission these weavers to create a new outfit for him.

Day after day, the swindlers pretended to work at their looms, though in reality, they did nothing at all. They requested the finest silk and gold threads, which they promptly hid away, continuing their ruse.

Curious to see the progress of his new clothes, the emperor sent his most trusted ministers to inspect the weavers' work. Each minister, fearing to be seen as unfit for their position if they could not see the fabric, praised the non-existent clothes' beauty and quality.

At last, the weavers announced that the emperor's new clothes were ready. They pretended to dress the emperor in his invisible garments, describing the colors and patterns of the fabric they supposedly wove.

The emperor, unable to see any clothes himself but afraid to admit it, paraded through the streets in his "new clothes" while his ministers and subjects marveled at their beauty, all pretending to see the magnificent garments.

As the emperor walked through the streets, a small child suddenly exclaimed, "But he has nothing on at all!"

The people whispered among themselves, and soon everyone began to murmur that the emperor was indeed naked. The truth spread like wildfire, and the emperor realized he had been deceived.

However, he continued to walk with dignity until he reached the palace. Too embarrassed to admit the truth, he pretended that nothing had happened and continued to parade in his invisible clothes.

The Pied Piper of Hamelin

In the town of Hamelin in Germany, the citizens were plagued by a rat infestation. The rats were everywhere: in homes, in the streets, and in the food stores. They gnawed on everything and spread disease, causing great distress to the townspeople.

The mayor and the town council tried everything to rid Hamelin of the rats—cats, traps, poison—but nothing worked. Just when they were beginning to lose hope, a mysterious stranger appeared in the town square. He was dressed in pied (multicolored) clothing and carried a pipe.

The stranger introduced himself as a rat-catcher and claimed that he could rid Hamelin of the rats for a fee. The mayor, desperate for a solution, promised the rat-catcher a large sum of money if he could deliver on his promise.

The rat-catcher took out his pipe and began to play a mesmerizing tune. To the astonishment of everyone, rats of all sizes and colors emerged from hiding and followed the pied piper as he led them out of town with his music. They followed him to the river Weser, where they drowned in the water.

With the town finally free of rats, the mayor and council members rejoiced and thanked the pied piper. However, when it came time to pay him the promised reward, the mayor reneged on his promise and offered the pied piper only a fraction of the agreed-upon amount.

Enraged and feeling betrayed, the pied piper warned the town of Hamelin that they would regret their decision. He vowed to take revenge in a way they would never forget.

One day, when the town was celebrating a church service, the pied piper returned to Hamelin. This time, he played a different tune, one that was haunting and irresistible. The sound drew all the children of Hamelin out of their homes and into the streets, where they followed the pied piper out of town and into a cave or mountain. The accounts vary in the story.

Among Arthur's most trusted knights were Sir Lancelot, renowned for his bravery and love for Queen Guinevere, and Sir Galahad, the purest of heart who eventually found the Holy Grail. Together, they faced challenges, battles, and betrayals, but always remained loyal to their king and their code of honor.

Mordred, Arthur's illegitimate son, betrayed him, leading to a final battle at Camlann where Arthur was mortally wounded. He entrusted Excalibur to Sir Bedivere, instructing him to return the sword to the Lady of the Lake.

Arthur's body was taken to Avalon for healing, and it's said he will one day return in Britain's hour of greatest need, known as the Once and Future King.

Unfortunately, her mother died of an unknown illness soon after she was born.

Enraged, she disguised herself as an old peddler woman and tricked Snow White into eating a poisoned apple. The poison put Snow White into a deep sleep that could only be broken by love's first kiss.

Heartbroken, the dwarfs placed Snow White in a glass coffin and mourned her. One day, a prince who had heard of Snow White's beauty came to the forest and found her asleep in the glass coffin. He instantly fell in love with her and kissed her gently. The kiss broke the spell, and Snow White awakened.
