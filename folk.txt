But the wife was not satisfied. She demanded a castle next. The fisherman, though reluctant, asked the fish again, and the wish was granted. The wife became greedier, demanding to become a queen, then an empress, and finally, to have the power of God. Each time, the fisherman asked the fish, and each wish was granted, though with increasing reluctance from the fish.
